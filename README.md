# Welcomments Templates & Samples

This repository contains sample Welcomments integrations for various static site generators.

The templates in this Git repository are complete sample projects that have Welcomments already integrated. This means that if you want to see the Welcomments Jekyll integration in action, you can do `cd jekyll && bundle install && jekyll serve`.

**These templates are also the source of truth** for [the Welcomments integration wizard](https://app.welcomments.io/new/choose). This means that these exact files are used for automatically creating a pull request that integrates Welcomments to the GitHub repository of your website. This is the same integration wizard that you can see in action [in this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIG7LTOrd1Q), where Welcomments is integrated to a new Hugo website from scratch in 1 minute and 54 seconds.
