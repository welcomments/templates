# Welcomments Templates & Samples

This repository contains sample Welcomments integrations for various static site generators.

## No but really, what is this stuff?

Welcomments is a comment system for static site generator based websites that pre-renders visitor comments in 100% static, prebuilt HTML. [The Welcomments website](https://welcomments.io/) has a quick run-through how Welcomments works. And [here's a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIG7LTOrd1Q) that shows how to integrate Welcomments to a Hugo website from scratch in 1 minute and 54 seconds.

The templates in this Git repository are complete sample projects that have Welcomments already integrated. This means that if you want to see the Welcomments Jekyll integration in action, you can do `cd jekyll && bundle install && jekyll serve`.

**These templates are also the source of truth** for [the Welcomments integration wizard](https://app.welcomments.io/new/choose). This means that these exact files are used for automatically creating a pull request that integrates Welcomments to the GitHub repository of your website. This is the same integration wizard that you saw in [the YouTube video above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIG7LTOrd1Q).
