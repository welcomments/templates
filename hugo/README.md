# Welcomments Hugo sample

Tested and built against [Hugo v0.96.0](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.96.0).

## Running it locally

- `hugo serve`

## How do I integrate these into my Hugo site?

The recommended way is to use [the Welcomments integration wizard](https://app.welcomments.io/new/choose).

If you prefer a manual approach, the Welcomments layouts you need to copy-paste are in the [layouts/partials/welcomments/ directory](layouts/partials/welcomments/), and the additional configuration instructions related to Hugo [are here](../_integration_instructions/hugo.md.eex).
