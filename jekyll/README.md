# Welcomments Jekyll sample

Tested and built against [Jekyll v4.2.2](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/releases/tag/v4.2.2).

## Running it locally

- `bundle install`
- `bundle exec jekyll serve`

## How do I integrate these into my Jekyll site?

The recommended way is to use [the Welcomments integration wizard](https://app.welcomments.io/new/choose).

If you prefer a manual approach, the Welcomments layouts you need to copy-paste are in the [\_includes/welcomments directory](_includes/welcomments/), and the additional configuration instructions related to Jekyll [are here](../_integration_instructions/jekyll.md.eex).
