Hello there, you, and welcome to Welcomments!

We already did the hardest part of the integration, but we do need a final push (pun intended) from you to get started.

## 1. Pull this PR to your local computer

You can do so by running `git fetch origin && git checkout <%= branch_name %>` in your local git repository.

## 2. Add Welcomments to your post layout

<%= specific_instructions %>

## 3. Push your changes

Finally, make a commit and push it to this very PR on GitHub:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Welcomments adjustments"
git push origin <%= branch_name %>
```

Merge this PR, wait for Netlify (or similar) to rebuild your site, and we should be done.

Time to start receiving some love letters from your readers!
