Set the base url for your Jekyll site in the config file:

**_config.yml:**
```
url: "https://mysite.com"
```

Then, add the following snippet to **_layouts/post.html**.

This is the Jekyll file where you usually define the layout for your individual posts.

```
{% include welcomments/comments.html website_id = "<%= website_id %>" %}
```
