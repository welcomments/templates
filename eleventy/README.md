# Welcomments 11ty (Eleventy) sample

Tested and built with [Eleventy v1.0.0](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

## Running it locally

- `npm install`
- `npx eleventy --serve`

## How do I integrate these into my Eleventy site?

The recommended way is to use [the Welcomments integration wizard](https://app.welcomments.io/new/choose).

If you prefer a manual approach, the Welcomments layouts you need to copy-paste are in the [\_includes/welcomments directory](_includes/welcomments/), and the additional configuration instructions related to 11ty [are here](../_integration_instructions/eleventy.md).
